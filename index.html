                <h2> Git Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Git is a version control system (VCS).

                <p>So what is version control software?</p>

                <p>In software development we work on files and constantly update files like add / remove / modify.
                    Often times we realise we have made some changes and it is now very late to recover the data as we
                    might have
                    overridden or deleted the file. And this issue exacerbates to multi folds if there are more than one
                    person working on files
                    in a project. To address the issues version control software is developed.</p>

                <p>VSC keeps a close eye on specific folder structure once instructed. Any files which are added,
                    modified, deleted are all
                    recorded. At any point we can go back in time to see what the status of the entire file structure so
                    that if required we
                    can go back and undo the changes made.</p>


                <p>There are many vendors providing types of version control software. Git is one among them. It uses
                    distributed
                    architecture instead of centralised version control system. (to avoid single point of failure)</p>


                <p>All it requires is installing Git software in our local device. We need learn some commands to
                    interact with the Git VC.
                    Here we need to see one important point. Git protects us from data loss from any inadvertent
                    actions. But what happens
                    to our data if device itself fails? To address this issue Git provides feature called GitHub.</p>
                <p>So what is GitHub? GitHub is a website interface for Git software installed in the cloud. This
                    portal enables users to
                    manage the data stored in the cloud.</p>

                </p>
                <h3>Git - Distributed architecture</h3>
                <p>

                    As shown in the below figure, first a repo (folder) is created in the GitHub (cloud) and all the
                    neccesary files are added to the remote repo and all files are committed which are now ready for the
                    users to clone it in their local machine. Now user can create local repo and clone the entire remote
                    repo into local repo.
                    The cloning step downloads entire data essentially mirroring the remote repo including the complete
                    version history and not just snapshots and thus provides completely localised operations which
                    enables fast access to all files (as everything is local).

                <h4>Key concepts</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Repository</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Git repository or repo in short is a folder that contains all the files adn history of a
                            proejct. As shown in the below figure, local repo are created in project user's machine and
                            remote repo is created in GitHub</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In git, there are three main areas : working folder, staging area and git folder (repo)</li>
                    <li>A file in the Git VCS undergoes following status
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="kc-highlight">Untracked</span> - Files which are newly added to the working
                                folder and Git has no info
                                about it or is not started to
                                track.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="kc-highlight">Modified</span> - Files which are already being tracked and
                                are yet to committed to database as
                                final change.</li>
                            <li><span class="kc-highlight">Unmodified</span> - informing that no changes are made to the
                                file.</li>
                            <li><span class="kc-highlight">Staged</span> - Files which are pushed to staging area (it is
                                just an index file recording
                                all info required for commit) and
                                awaiting for final commit i.e. recorded in snapshot.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Commit
                        <ul>
                            <li>A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. Git takes snapshot of
                                entire folder system which reflect the new changes along with only
                                references to the files which
                                are not changed. Almost all operations of Git is local hence the speed! It only refers
                                the local data to display entire
                                history without contacting any other system.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>branching
                        <ul>
                            <li>Git allows you to create branches to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments
                                independently. The main branch, often
                                called "master" or "main," is the default branch where the stable code resides</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Merge
                        <ul>
                            <li>Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. It's a way to
                                integrate new features or bug
                                fixes into the main branch.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Push and pull

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Pulling is the act of getting changes from a remote repository to your local repository,
                                while pushing is sending your
                                local changes to the remote repository. This ensures collaboration and synchronization
                                among team members.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>In local repo, any files added, modified needs to be first pushed into staging area before
                        committing as final change
                    </li>

                </ul>

                    can clone a remote repo. This gives all the tools required to manage files locally.</p>
